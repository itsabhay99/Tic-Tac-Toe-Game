# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game






The game board consists of a 3x3 grid of squares, with each square representing a position where a player can place their marker. The markers are typically X's and O's, and players take turns placing their markers on the board until one player gets three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or all squares are filled without a winner.

The design of the tic tac toe game can vary depending on the preferences of the designer. However, a typical design may include a background image or pattern, and buttons to start a new game or reset the current game.

JavaScript is used to provide the game's logic and interactivity. It handles player turns, determines if a move is valid, checks for a winner, and updates the game board accordingly. It can also be used to implement additional features such as player names, scorekeeping, and animations.

Overall, a tic tac toe game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a fun and engaging game that can be enjoyed in a web browser. Its design and functionality can be customized to meet the specific needs of the user or website.
